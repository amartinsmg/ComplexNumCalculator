# ComplexNumCalculator

This's a personal project for a web complex numbers calculator. The user inputs the operators and chooses the operation between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The page uses a Webassembly module to calculate the operation and Typescript transpiled code to format and display the result to the user.

The page uses Bootstrap Dark 5 for styling and Mathjax library to convert the result to svg format.
