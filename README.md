# Complex Numbers Calculator

The Complex Numbers Calculator is a web-based application for performing arithmetic operations on complex numbers. 

> In mathematics, a complex number is an element of a number system that extends the real numbers with a specific element denoted i, called the imaginary unit and satisfying the equation i2 = −1; every complex number can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Because no real number satisfies the above equation, i was called an imaginary number by René Descartes. For the complex number a + bi, a is called the real part and b is called the imaginary part.

The application provides two input fields for the real and imaginary parts of each complex number, respectively. Users can select the desired operation by clicking on the corresponding button, and the result is displayed in a formatted manner using Typescript code.

The page uses Bootstrap Dark 5 for styling and Mathjax library to convert the result to svg format.
